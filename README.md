# My Portfolio Website

I love this design by [Britney Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/#contact)
This is a link to [Britney's Github Repo](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4)

I wanted to achieve a similar design, but write my own code. My version is 
definitely not as good as hers yet. A work in progress...
Right now, I am just trying to get my own website set up,
and hope to improve this as time goes on.
